# Overview
In this step you connect your SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) system to Kyma runtime. The outcome is that the C4C system's APIs and Events metadata are registered in the Kyma runtime Service Catalog and the secured connectivity between C4C system and Kyma runtime, hence all extensions you implement leverage it.
# Prerequisites
* You have administration access to your C4C system
# Steps
1. Sign in to your C4C system using user with administration privileges.

1. Navigate to _General Settings_ and click on _Event Notification_ menu (under System Administration group). Hint - you can use the browser find function to easily navigate.
